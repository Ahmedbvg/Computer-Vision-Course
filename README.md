Computer Vision Course Projects

This repository contains projects and assignments completed during my Computer Vision course.
The work focuses on applying both classical computer vision techniques and deep learning models to solve real-world problems such as object detection, pose estimation, and image segmentation.

📌 Projects Included
🔹 Safety Vest Object Detection (YOLO)

Detects safety vests worn by workers using a YOLO-based object detection model to improve workplace safety and enable real-time monitoring.

🔹 Sign Language Recognition (Pose Estimation)

Recognizes sign language gestures using human pose and hand keypoints extracted through pose estimation techniques.

🔹 Image Segmentation

Performs pixel-level classification to segment objects or regions of interest in images using deep learning-based segmentation models.

🔹 OpenCV Projects

A collection of classical computer vision tasks implemented using OpenCV, including:

Image processing

Edge detection

Face detection

🔹 Hugging Face Computer Vision Project

Applies pre-trained computer vision models from Hugging Face for tasks such as image classification or object detection using transfer learning.
