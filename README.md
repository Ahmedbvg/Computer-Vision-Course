# Computer Vision Course Projects 

This repository contains all projects and assignments completed during my **Computer Vision course**.  
The work focuses on applying both **classical computer vision techniques** and **deep learning models** to solve real-world problems such as **object detection, pose estimation, and image segmentation**.

## 📌 Projects Included
**Safety Vest Object Detection (YOLO)**  
Detects safety vests worn by workers using a YOLO-based object detection model to improve workplace safety and enable real-time monitoring.  

**Sign Language Recognition (Pose Estimation)**  
Recognizes sign language gestures using human pose and hand keypoints extracted through pose estimation techniques.  

**Image Segmentation**  
Performs pixel-level classification to segment objects or regions of interest using deep learning-based segmentation models.  

**OpenCV Projects**  
A collection of classical computer vision tasks, including:  
- Image processing  
- Edge detection  
- Face detection  

**Hugging Face Computer Vision Project**  
Applies pre-trained computer vision models from Hugging Face for tasks such as image classification or object detection using transfer learning.  

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- YOLO (Ultralytics)  
- PyTorch / TensorFlow  
- MediaPipe (Pose & Hand Estimation)
